## Hi there 👋

I'm Juan Antonio, a Science and Systems engineering student from Guatemala who loves to learn new things in the world of DevOps. My passion for technology has driven me to pursue a career in the field of DevOps, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve myself.


I have experience with DevOps tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I have experience at creating and managing cloud infrastructures and I have background in infrastructure automation and software engineering. 

I'm a self-directed learner who actively seeks out ways to further my knowledge and stay up-to-date on the latest DevOps trends. I'm a great team player who is able to take feedback, analyze it, and act upon it quickly. I'm also great at communication and is eager to share his knowledge with others
